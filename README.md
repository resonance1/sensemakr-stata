# sensemakr: Sensitivity Analysis Tools for OLS  <img src="misc/sensemakr-logo-small.png" align="right" />

`sensemakr` for Stata implements a suite of sensitivity analysis tools that
extends the traditional omitted variable bias framework and makes it
easier to understand the impact of omitted variables in regression
models, as discussed in [Cinelli, C. and Hazlett, C. (2020) “Making
Sense of Sensitivity: Extending Omitted Variable Bias.” Journal of the
Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Statistical
Methodology).](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12348)
